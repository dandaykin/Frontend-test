                I am Highly motivated and have spent time researching a broad range of different artistic genres. I enjoy making my own
                art pieces and submitting work to competitions frequently for fun. I am a video game enthusiast, showing interest in certain works
                for their story and artistic style. For example, often use pre-existing concept art from Warframe as inspiration and as references,
                mostly artwork by Liger Inuzuka.
